# auth0-test

Small test app to try out Auth0 for Google Login.

I built this back in 2022 while trying to figure out how we could improve our authentication solution at [Raise](https://github.com/raisenational).

Ultimately we decided that using Auth0 didn't make things that much easier, and considering how painful it was to go through their software sales process it was simpler to improve our own internal system.
